    <p>Are you lonesome tonight?
        <br> Do you miss me tonight?
        <br> You sorry we drifted apart?
        <br> Does your memory stray to a bright summer day
        <br> When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?
        <br> Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
        <br> Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
        <br> Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?
        <br> Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?
        <br> I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
        <br> You know someone said that the world's a stage and each of us must play a part
        <br> Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart
        <br> Act one was where we met
        <br> I loved you at first glance
        <br> You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue
        <br> Then came act two, you seemed to change, you acted strange
        <br> And why I've never known
        <br> Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
        <br> And I had no cause to doubt you
        <br> But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
        <br> Than to go on living without you
        <br> Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
        <br> With emptiness all around
        <br> And if you won't come back to me
        <br> Then they can bring the curtain down
        <br> Is your heart filled with pain
        <br> Shall I come back again?
        <br> Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?
    </p>
